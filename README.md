# CGBoilerplate
CGBoilerplate provides commonly used operations used in the development of CG applications in a single, uniform and
consistent API. Common operations include window management and input handling, maths, loading 3D models, loading images
etc.

Currently, this project focuses on OpenGL as a graphics API, but it's goal is to also expand to DirectX (11/12), Vulkan 
and Metal.

### Features
 - Window and input handling framework
 - Graphics API loading
 - Maths library

# Dependencies
CGBoilerplate depends on and provides the following libraries:
 - GLFW (used for the window and input framework)
 - GLAD (used to load OpenGL)
 - GLM (maths library)
 - Assimp (importing meshes and models)
 - various stb headers (loading images etc.)
